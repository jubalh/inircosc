inircosc is an '''in'''teractive '''irssi''' '''co'''nfiguration '''sc'''ript.

== How you get it ==
git clone ...

== Run it ==
<source>cd inircosc</source>
<source>./inircosc.sh</source>

== What it will do ==
If you already have an irssi <source>config</source> file in <source>~/.irssi/</source> then inircosc will move it to <source>~/.irssi.config.old</source>.

After that it will walk you through the setup. Should be quite self explaining.
Sometimes you have to choose if you want a specific setting or not. To let you jump over these steps quickly inircosc uses default settings.
You will see the default value in paranthesis, so if you just press <source>Enter</source> it will take this value.

Sometimes no user input will tell the script that you are finished with this option.
For Example if you added a server, inircosc asks you for another. If skip it with <source>Enter</source> the script will continue.

However if you skip over things like setting your username, then the username will just be empty.
